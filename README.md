# DLA

A super naive usage of DLA to generate a universe as seen in EVE.
Stutters a lot, the whole thing is under-optimized and takes around 5-10mins to generate 5000+ systems but it works.

Using unity physics wasnt a good idea but it results in a few interesting variations ; for example, making walkers move too fast and having them overshoot the parent node. It sort of kills the DLA "organic structure" but results in a big difference in distance between linked nodes giving adding a lot more variation between the branches.
